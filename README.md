This project is part of my final thesis at Alexander Technological Institute of Thessaloniki,
School of Technological Applications, Department of Informatics.

The general title of my thesis is "Visualization of numerical analysis methods for equations solving" and
I implement this project on Matlab 2010b. The application will be used as an education tool for the relevant 
course "Numerical Analysis" of Department of Informatics.

I have already implemented the three basic algorithms were are demonstrated in the relevant course:
1. Boltzano method
2. Newton-Raphson method
3. Regula Falsi method
